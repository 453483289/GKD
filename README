Here are steps to compile GKD. GKD is depends on some my other projects, all are open source and written in Java & maven. So just do “mvn clean install” in every of them.

Check out these project in order, run “mvn clean install” on every of them:

1. https://github.com/mcheung63/peter-swing
2. https://code.google.com/p/tightvncpanel/
3. https://code.google.com/p/peter-ar/
4. https://code.google.com/p/peter-dwarf/

Finally, get GKD source from svn://svn.petersoft.com/GKD, username : gkd, password : gkd.

1) execute the command in installJar.txt
2) run “mvn clean package”, you will have a GKDxxxxx.jar in your target folder, now you are ready to run it.
3) download this
4) cd to the unzipped folder, run “java -jar GKD-20150124.jar -f gkd_bochs.xml”
5) read gkd_bochs.xml, then you know everything.
